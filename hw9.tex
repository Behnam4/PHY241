  \begin{enumerate}
    \item (64) What is the smallest Bragg angle for x rays of wavelength 30pm to reflect from reflecting planes spaced 0.30 nm apart in a calcite crystal?
    \item (66) An x-ray beam of a certain wavelength is incident on a NaCl crystal, at 30.0째 to a certain family of reflecting planes of spacing 39.8 pm. If the reflection from those planes is of the first order, what is the wavelength of the x rays?
    \item (67) Figure 36-46 is a graph of intensity versus angular position $\theta$ for the diffraction of an x-ray beam by a crystal. The horizontal scale is set by $\theta=2.00째$. The beam consists of two wavelengths, and the spacing between the reflecting planes is 0.94 nm. What are the (a) shorter and (b) longer wavelengths in the beam?
    \item (70) In Fig. 36-47, first-order reflection from the reflection planes shown occurs when an x-ray beam of wavelength 0.260 nm makes an angle $\theta=63.8째$ with the top face of the crystal. What is the unit cell size $a_0$?
    \item (77) In a single-slit diffraction experiment, there is a minimum of intensity for orange light ($\lambda=600 nm$) and a minimum of intensity for blue-green light ($\lambda=500 nm$) at the same angle of 1.00 mrad. For what minimum slit width is this possible?
    \item (84) In a two-slit interference pattern, what is the ratio of slit separation to slit width if there are 17 bright fringes within the central diffraction envelope and the diffraction minima coincide with twoslit interference maxima?
    \item (96) When monochromatic light is incident on a slit $22.0 \mu m$ wide, the first diffraction minimum lies at 1.80째 from the direction of the incident light.What is the wavelength?
